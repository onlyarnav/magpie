# checker

Stdlib-only Python project implementing the approved-LLM gate-check
for the Magpie privacy-llm tool. One console script:

| Console script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `privacy-llm-check` | Parse `<project-config>/privacy-llm.md`, verify every entry in the *Currently configured LLM stack* section is approved per the rules in [`../models.md`](../models.md). Exit 0 if all approved, 1 with stderr explanation otherwise (2 if the config file cannot be located or parsed). |

The behavioural contract — which entries are default-approved, which
require an opt-in declaration with a data-residency contract + PMC
sign-off — lives in [`../models.md`](../models.md). The skill-side
wiring contract is in [`../wiring.md`](../wiring.md). This README
covers local invocation.

## Run

From the framework's root (this repository when running standalone;
the snapshot path inside an adopting tracker repo):

```bash
# Default lookup — reads <cwd>/.apache-magpie/privacy-llm.md or
# <cwd>/.apache-magpie-overrides/privacy-llm.md.
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/checker privacy-llm-check

# Skill-style invocation: tells the user the check fires because
# the skill may read <private-list> content.
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/checker privacy-llm-check --reads-private-list

# Explicit config path:
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/checker privacy-llm-check \
  --config <project-config>/privacy-llm.md

# Quiet mode (no output on approval; non-zero exit + stderr on rejection):
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/checker privacy-llm-check --quiet
```

Skill files reference the same invocation via the `<framework>`
placeholder so the path resolves in either context:

```bash
uv run --project <framework>/tools/privacy-llm/checker privacy-llm-check ...
```

`<framework>` substitutes to the snapshot path inside an adopting
project (typically `.apache-magpie/apache-steward/`) and to `.`
when running standalone — see the placeholder convention in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md#placeholder-convention-used-in-skill-files).

## Config file lookup

In order of precedence:

| Source | Notes |
|---|---|
| `--config <path>` | Explicit override; absolute or relative to `<cwd>`. |
| `$PRIVACY_LLM_CONFIG` | Environment-variable override. |
| `<cwd>/.apache-magpie/privacy-llm.md` | Standard adopter location (the framework's `<project-config>` substitutes here). |
| `<cwd>/.apache-magpie-overrides/privacy-llm.md` | Alternative location used by adopters who keep overrides in a separate dir. |

If none of the candidates exist, the checker exits 2 with the list
of paths it tried.

## Test

```bash
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/checker --group dev pytest
```

## Lint / type-check

```bash
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/checker --group dev ruff check src tests
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/checker --group dev ruff format --check src tests
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/checker --group dev mypy
```
