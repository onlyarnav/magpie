"""Audit logic for Claude Code `permissions.allow[]` entries.

Pure data + classification — no I/O. The CLI layer in `cli.py`
drives reads/writes; this module just answers "given the allow
list and the opted-in families, what should be removed and what
should be added?".

Two canonical lists:

- `FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS` — broad wildcards that grant arbitrary code
  execution. Any match → ✗ removal proposal. The list is
  **deliberately not exhaustive** (see the *"same category"* rule
  in the verify check 8d doc) — these are the concrete patterns we
  have observed accumulating in real adopter trees.
- `RECOMMENDED_BY_FAMILY` — narrow read-only patterns the framework
  invokes constantly. Family-scoped: an adopter who skipped a
  family does not see its recommendations flagged as gaps.
