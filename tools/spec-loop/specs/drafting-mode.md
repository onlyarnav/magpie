title: Drafting mode
status: experimental
kind: feature
mode: Drafting
source: >
  MISSION.md § Technical scope (Drafting). docs/modes.md § Drafting.
  Implemented by security-issue-fix (stable, security-only) and
  issue-fix-workflow (experimental).
acceptance:
  - A drafting skill produces the failing test, the smallest production
    change, targeted test runs, and a commit — but never merges.
  - The PR is opened via `gh pr create --web` (human reviews in browser)
    or handed back for the human to push; no autopilot push/merge.
  - Security-class drafts scrub CVE / tracker-slug / "security fix" /
    "vulnerability" from every public surface until the embargo lifts.

# Drafting mode

## What it does

The agent drafts a fix for a well-scoped problem — a triaged issue, a
CVE-allocated security report with team consensus on scope, a failing
test with an obvious cause, a documentation hole — and prepares a PR.
Every PR is reviewed and merged by a human committer; the agent never
merges its own work.

## Where it lives

- `security-issue-fix` (stable, security-only) — drafts the fix in the
  user's local `<upstream>` clone, runs local checks, opens the public
  PR via `gh pr create --web`, scrubs confidential framing.
- `issue-fix-workflow` (experimental) — drafts a fix for a triaged
  general-issue; **does not** open the PR on autopilot, hands back a
  branch + commits + test results for the human to push.
- `tools/dev` — shared local-check helpers.

## Behaviour & contract

- **Draft, never merge.** No skill in this mode merges. Opening the PR is
  `gh pr create --web` (human confirms in the browser) or a hand-back.
- **Confidentiality scrub** (security): commit message, branch name, PR
  title/body, newsfragment are scrubbed for CVE IDs, the tracker repo
  slug, and the words "security fix" / "vulnerability" before any write
  or push (see `AGENTS.md` § Confidentiality).
- **Commit trailer** `Generated-by:` — never `Co-Authored-By:` an agent.

## Out of scope

- Generic Drafting beyond security + general-issue (lint fixes, audit-
  tool findings, doc holes at scale) — `proposed`, not yet built.
- Merging, releasing, or pushing without a human.

## Acceptance criteria

1. No drafting skill merges or force-pushes.
2. Security drafts pass the confidentiality scrub before any public write.
3. `skill-and-tool-validate` passes on the drafting-family skills.

## Validation

```bash
uv run --project tools/skill-and-tool-validator --group dev skill-and-tool-validate
```

## Known gaps

- Generic (non-security, non-issue) Drafting from audit-tool findings is
  `proposed`. Only `security-issue-fix` is stable today.
