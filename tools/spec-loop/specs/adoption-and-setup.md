title: Adoption & setup
status: stable
kind: feature
mode: infra
source: >
  README.md § How adoption works / Adopting the framework / Maintenance.
  Implemented by the setup family (setup-steward and siblings) and the
  snapshot + agentic-override model.
acceptance:
  - An adopter commits exactly one skill (setup-steward); everything else
    is a gitignored snapshot plus committed override + lock files.
  - The committed lock pins install method + URL + ref so a fresh clone
    re-installs the same framework version.
  - Drift between the committed pin and the local install is detected and
    surfaced with an upgrade proposal.

# Adoption & setup

## What it does

Gets the framework into an adopter repo and keeps it current using a
**snapshot + agentic-override** model: one committed bootstrap skill, a
gitignored framework snapshot (a build artefact, never committed),
gitignored skill symlinks, and committed agent-readable override files.

## Where it lives

- Skill: `setup-steward` (adopt, verify, upgrade, override).
- Skills: `setup-isolated-setup-install` / `-update` / `-verify`
  (the sandbox harness), `setup-override-upstream` (promote a stabilised
  override into a framework PR), `setup-shared-config-sync`.
- Docs: `docs/setup/` (install recipes, agentic-overrides contract,
  prerequisites).
- Lock files: `.apache-steward.lock` (committed pin) and
  `.apache-steward.local.lock` (gitignored, what this machine fetched).

## Behaviour & contract

- **One committed skill, no submodules, no vendored framework copies.**
  The snapshot lives in a gitignored `.apache-steward/`.
- **Committed lock is the source of truth.** A fresh contributor runs
  `/setup-steward` and re-installs to the project's pinned version.
- **Drift detection** at the top of every framework skill: if the
  gitignored local lock has drifted from the committed pin, the skill
  proposes `/setup-steward upgrade`.
- **Overrides are agent-readable Markdown** under
  `.apache-steward-overrides/`, consulted at runtime and merged before
  default behaviour ([pairing/correctability is the model]).

## Out of scope

- The runtime behaviour of the modes themselves.
- Editing the adopter's `.claude/settings.json` beyond what the install
  recipe declares.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Adoption commits only the bootstrap skill + lock/override scaffold.
2. The committed lock re-installs the same version on a fresh clone.
3. Drift between local and committed locks is surfaced with an upgrade.

## Validation

```bash
test -f docs/setup/README.md
uv run --project tools/skill-and-tool-validator --group dev skill-and-tool-validate
```

## Known gaps

- `stable`; gaps appear as new adopter skill-directory layouts to support
  or new override surfaces — recorded by the plan pass.
