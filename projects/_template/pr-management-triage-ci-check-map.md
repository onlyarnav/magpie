# TODO: `<Project Name>` — pr-management-triage CI-check to doc-URL map

This file is the **CI-check categorisation table** for the
[`pr-management-triage`](../../skills/pr-management-triage/SKILL.md) skill's
violations comments. It holds the concrete mapping for your
adopter project.

Copy this file into your own
`<project-config>/pr-management-triage-ci-check-map.md` and
replace the `<placeholder>` URLs with your project's
documentation paths. Add or adjust rows so the patterns match
the GitHub check names your CI actually emits.

## Table

Each row maps a **GitHub check name pattern** (case-insensitive substring match) to a **human-readable category name** the skill prints in the violations comment, plus a **doc URL** the skill links to.

By default, the table contains only a catch-all pattern (`*`) pointing to `<upstream_contributing_docs_url>`, reducing duplication and maintenance. If your project has distinct contributing or troubleshooting documents for different areas (e.g. static checks vs unit tests), you can add finer-grained rows above the catch-all. More-specific patterns must precede broader ones.

| Pattern | Category | Doc URL |
|---|---|---|
| `*` (catch-all) | Failing CI checks | `<upstream_contributing_docs_url>` |

Add additional rows for project-specific check-name patterns above the catch-all when finer categorisation is desired:

```markdown
| `<your-check-name-substring>` | <Human category> | <doc-url> |
```

## Notes

- **Order matters.** The skill matches first-found; more-specific
  patterns are listed above broader ones (e.g. `mypy-<sub-project>`
  matches the `mypy-` row, so put `<sub-project>`-scoped patterns
  above the generic `mypy-` row if you want them split out).
- **Mergeability fallback.** If the PR has `mergeable ==
  CONFLICTING`, the skill emits a separate "Merge conflicts"
  category linking to the project's git / rebase doc:

| Concept | Doc URL |
|---|---|
| Merge conflicts (rebase guide) | `<git-rebase-doc-url>` |

- **Failing-CI fallback.** If `checks_state == FAILURE` but no
  failed check names are extractable, the skill emits a generic
  "Failing CI checks" entry pointing at the same doc URL as the
  catch-all row above.
